# Simple Rust 

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

- `println!` is a macro, not a function, it replaces code
- function `main` does not return a value (almost true)

.card[.large[.center[![Hello Rust](../images/sep_hello.png)]]]

---
## `print!` & `println!`
- Print stuff out. Yay.
- Use `{}` for general string interpolation, and `{:?}` for debug printing.
    - Some types can only be printed with `{:?}`, like arrays and `Vec`s.

```rust
print!("{}, {}, {}", "foo", 3, true);
// => foo, 3, true
println!("{:?}, {:?}", "foo", [1, 2, 3]);
// => "foo", [1, 2, 3]
```


## `format!` 
- Uses `println!`-style string interpolation to create formatted `String`s.

```rust
let fmted = format!("{}, {:x}, {:?}", 12, 155, [1,2,3]);
// fmted == "12, 9b, [1,2,3]"
```

---

## Workpoint 1 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="120" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

Write the text

```rust
// let name = ...
println! ("Hello Rusters, I am {} and Rust is awseome", );
```

---

## Security Tip .top_image[![Seatbelt](../images/seatbelt.png)] Format Injection

Missuse of `printf` format

```c
// program: penguin-tiger-manatee
#include <stdio.h>

#define LEN 255

int main() {
    char s[LEN];
    fgets (s, LEN-1, stdin);
    printf (s);
    return 0;
}
```

The same source in Rust

```rust
use std::io::{self, stdin, Read};

fn main () {
  let mut s = String::new();
  io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut s).unwrap();
  println! (buffer);
}
```

---

## `panic!(msg)`
- Exits current task with given message.
- Don't do this lightly! It is better to handle and report errors explicitly.

```rust
if x < 0 {
    panic!("Oh noes!");
}
```

## `assert!` & `assert_eq!`

- `assert!(condition)` panics if `condition` is `false`.
- `assert_eq!(left, right)` panics if `left != right`.
- `debug_assert!(condition)` and `debug_assert_eq!(left, right)` work in debug build, but omitted in release build.

```rust
let actual = 1 + 2;
assert!(actual == 3);
assert_eq!(3, actual);
```

---
## `unreachable!()`

- Used to indicate that some code should not be reached.
- `panic!`s when reached.
- Can be useful to track down unexpected bugs (e.g. optimization bugs).

```rust
if false {
    unreachable!();
}
```


## `unimplemented!()`

- Shorthand for `panic!("not yet implemented")`.

```rust
fn sum(x: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    // TODO
    unimplemented!();
}
```

---

## `dbg!()`

- A macro for quick and dirty debugging with which you can inspect the value of a given expression.
- Was added in Rust 1.32.

```rust
let a = 2;
let b = dbg!(a * 2) + 1;
//      ^-- prints: [src/main.rs:2] a * 2 = 4
assert_eq!(b, 5);
```

---

## Variable Bindings ###
- Variables are bound with `let`:
```rust
let x = 17;
```

- Bindings are implicitly-typed: the compiler infers based on context.
- The compiler can't always determine the type of a variable, so sometimes you
  have to add type annotations.
```rust
let x: i16 = 17;
```

- Variables are inherently immutable:
```rust
let x = 5;
x += 1; // error: re-assignment of immutable variable x
let mut y = 5;
y += 1; // OK!
```

---
## Variable Bindings ###
- Bindings may be shadowed:
```rust
let x = 17;
let y = 53;
let x = "Shadowed!";
// x is not mutable, but we're able to re-bind it
```

- The shadowed binding for `x` above lasts until it goes out of scope.
- Above, we've effectively lost the first binding, since both `x`s are in the same scope.

- Patterns may also be used to declare variables:
```rust
let (a, b) = ("foo", 12);
let [c, d] = [1, 2];
```

# Workpoint 2 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="120" music="../music/workpoint_extra.mp3"></span>)

Print the a + b expression

```rust
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
// print debug information for the a + b expression
```

There are some macros to help you.

---
class: split-70
# Primitive Types 

.column[
- `unit`: () (similar with `void` from C)
- `bool`: `true` and `false`
- `char`: `'c'` or `'ðŸ˜º'` (`char`s are Unicode code-points, i.e. 4 bytes long!)

- Numerics: specify the signedness and size.
    - `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `isize`
    - `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `usize`
    - `f32`, `f64`
    - `isize` & `usize` are the size of pointers (and therefore have
        machine-dependent size)
    - Literals are spelled like `10i8`, `10u16`, `10.0f32`, `10usize`.
    - Type inference for non-specific literals default to `i32` or `f64`:
      - e.g. `10` defaults to `i32`, `10.0` defaults to `f64`.
]

.column[
.card[.small[.center[![Data Types](../images/sep_datatypes.png)]]]
]


---
## Arrays
- Arrays are generically of type `[T; N]`.
    - N is a compile-time _constant_. Arrays cannot be resized.
    - Array access is bounds-checked at runtime.
    - No const generics yet. (planned to be added in 2019)
- Arrays are indexed with `[]` like most other languages:
    - `arr[3]` gives you the 4th element of `arr`

```rust
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3]; // (array of 3 elements)
let arr2 = [2; 32];   // (array of 32 `2`s)
```

.card[.small[.center[![Array Define](../images/sep_array_define.png) ![Array Access](../images/sep_array_access.png)]]]

---
## Slices
- Generically of type `&[T]`
- A "view" into an array (or heap allocated data) by reference
- Not created directly, but are borrowed from other variables
- Mutable `&mut [T]` or immutable `&[T]`

```rust
let arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let val = arr[0];               // val = 0
let total_slice = &arr;         // Slice all of `arr`
let total_slice = &arr[..];     // Same, but more explicit
let partial_slice = &arr[2..5]; // [2, 3, 4]
```

---
## Strings
- Two types of Rust strings: `String` and `&str`.
- `String` is a heap-allocated, growable vector of characters.
- `&str` is a type&sup1; that's used to slice into `String`s.
- String literals like `"foo"` are of type `&str`.
- Strings are guaranteed to be encoded using UTF-8

```rust
let s: &str = "galaxy";
let s2: String = "Ð³Ð°Ð»Ð°ÐºÑ‚Ð¸ÐºÐ°".to_string();
let s3: String = String::from("éŠ€æ¼¢");
let s4: &str = &s3;
```

```rust
let s1 = "foobar";
// You can slice strings:
let s2 = &s1[1..3];
// But you can't index with []
// you can use `s1.chars().nth(1).unwrap()` instead
let s3 = s1[1] // does not work!
```

&sup1;`str` is an unsized type, which doesn't have a compile-time known size,
and therefore cannot exist by itself.

---
## Tuples 
- Fixed-size, ordered, heterogeneous lists
- Index into tuples with `foo.0`, `foo.1`, etc.
- Can be destructured for example in `let` bindings

```rust
let foo: (i32, char, f64) = (72, 'H', 5.1);
let (x, y, z) = (72, 'H', 5.1);
let (a, b, c) = foo; // a = 72, b = 'H', c = 5.1
```
  
---
## References 

- Reference *types* are written with an `&`: `&i32`.
- References can be taken with `&` (like C/C++).
- References can be _dereferenced_ with `*` (like C/C++).
- References are guaranteed to be valid.
    - Validity is enforced through compile-time checks!
- These are *not* the same as pointers!
- Reference lifetimes are pretty complex, as we'll explore later on in the course.

```rust
let x = 12;
let ref_x = &x;
println!("{}", *ref_x); // 12
```

---
# Casting 

- Cast between types with `as`:

```rust
let x: i32 = 100;
let y: u32 = x as u32;
```

- Naturally, you can only cast between types that are safe to cast between.
    - No casting `[i16; 4]` to `char`! (This is called a "non-scalar" cast)
    - There are unsafe mechanisms to overcome this, if you know what you're doing.


---
# Expressions

- (Almost!) everything is an expression: something which returns a value.
    - Exception: variable bindings are not expressions.
- The "nothing" type is called "unit", which is written `()`.
    - The _type_ `()` has only one value: `()`.
    - `()` is the default return type.
- Discard an expression's value by appending a semicolon. Now it returns `()`.
    - Hence, if a function ends in a semicolon, it returns `()`.

```rust
fn foo() -> i32 { 5 }
fn bar() -> () { () }
fn baz() -> () { 5; }
fn qux()       { 5; }
```


---
# Control Flow

- `if` and `match` 
- `while` and `loop`
- `for` iteration

---
## If Statements

```rust
let x = 10;

if x > 0 {
    println! ("positive");
} else if x == 0 {
    println! ("zero");
} else {
    println! ("negative");
}
```
- No parentheses necessary.
- Entire if statement evaluates to one expression, so every arm must end with
  an expression of the same type.
    - In this example is it unit `()`:

---
# Workpoint 3 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="120" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

Assign to `max` the value of the maximum between a and b  without changing its mutability.

```rust
let a = 10;
let b = 100;
let max = ...

println! ("The maximum {}", max);
```

Remeber, **almost everything is an expression** that returns a value.

---

## `match` 
- `switch` on steroids.

```rust
let x = 3;

match x {
    1 => println!("one fish"),  // <- comma required
    2 => {
        println!("two fish");
        println!("two fish");
    },  // <- comma optional when using braces
    // we can match several patterns in one arm
    3 | 4 => println!("three or four, dunno"),
    _ => println!("no fish for you"), // "otherwise" case
}
```

- `match` takes an expression (`x`) and branches on a list of `value => expression` statements.
- The entire match evaluates to one expression.
    - Like `if`, all arms must evaluate to the same type.
- `_` is commonly used as a catch-all (cf. Haskell, OCaml)

---

# Workpoint 4 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="120" music="../music/workpoint_alt.mp3"></span>)

Write a `match` that prints if a number is odd or even.

```rust
let n = 10;

let t = match n {
  ... =>
  ... =>
}

println! ("{} is {}", n, t);
```

.card[.small[.center[![Match](../images/sep_match.png)]]]

---
## `match` pattern
```rust
let x = 3;
let y = -3;
let q = 10;

let s = match (x, y) {
    (1, 1) => "one".to_string(),
    (2, j) => format!("two, {}", j),
    (_, 3) => "three".to_string(),
    (i, j) if i > 5 && j < 0 => "On guard!".to_string(),
    // NB: note that we do not test x == 10 here!
    (q, k) => format!("???: {} {}", q, k),
};
println!("{}", s);
```

- The matched expression can be any expression (l-value), including tuples and function calls.
    - Matches can bind variables. `_` is a throw-away variable name.
- You _must_ write an exhaustive match in order to compile.
- Use `if`-guards to constrain a match to certain conditions.
- Patterns can get very complex.

---

# Workpoint 5 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint_extra.mp3"></span>)

Calculate the factorial (n!) of a number. Panic if computation is not possible.

```rust
fn factorial (n: i32) -> u32 {
  match n {
    _ => unimplemented!()
  }
}

fn main () {
  println! ("10!: {} 0!: {} -10: {}", factorial(10), factorial(0), factorial(-10));
}
```

You will have to perform a typecast.

---

## `while` 
- Loops come in three flavors: `while`, `loop`, and `for`.
    - `break` and `continue` exist just like in most languages

- `while` works just like you'd expect:

```rust
let mut x = 0;
while x < 100 {
    x += 1;
    println!("x: {}", x);
}
```

While loops are not expressions.

---
## `loop` 
- `loop` is equivalent to `while true`, a common pattern.
    - Plus, the compiler can make optimizations knowing that it's infinite.

```rust
let mut x = 0;
loop {
    x += 1;
    println!("x: {}", x);
}
```

Loops are not expressions.

---
## `for` iteration
- `for` is the most different from most C-like languages
     - `for` loops use an _iterator expression_:
     - `n..m` creates an iterator from n to m (exclusive).
     - Some data structures can be used as iterators, like arrays and `Vec`s.

```rust
// Loops from 0 to 9.
for x in 0..10 {
    println!("{}", x);
}

let xs = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];
// Loop through elements in a slice of `xs`.
for x in &xs {
    println!("{}", x);
}
```

For loops are not expressions.

---
# Workpoint 6 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="120" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

Assign to `max` the value of the maximum number in the array. Do not use any function.

```rust
let v = [1,2,4,5,23,54,6,7,34,6,6,3];
let max = v[0];
// ...

println! ("The maximum {}", max);
```

Remeber array slices are iterators that return references to array elements.

---

# Functions 

```rust
fn foo(x: T, y: U, z: V) -> T {
    // ...
}
```
.column[
- `foo` is a function that takes three parameters:
    - `x` of type `T`
    - `y` of type `U`
    - `z` of type `V`
- `foo` returns a `T`.
]

.column[
.card[.small[.center[![Function](../images/sep_function.png)]]]
]

<br>

- Must explicitly define argument and return types.
    - The compiler is actually smart enough to figure this out for you, but
      Rust's designers decided it was better practice to force explicit function
      typing.

---
## Functions Return

- The final expression in a function is its return value.
    - Use `return` for _early_ returns from a function.

```rust
fn square(n: i32) -> i32 {
    n * n
}

fn squareish(n: i32) -> i32 {
    if n < 5 { return n; }
    n * n
}

fn square_bad(n: i32) -> i32 {
    n * n;
}
```

- The last one won't even compile!
  - Why? 

---

# Workpoint 7 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="120" music="../music/workpoint_alt.mp3"></span>)

1. Write the `maximum` function that returns the maximum of a and b

  ```rust
  let a = 10;
  let b = 100;
  let max = maximum (a, b);
  
  println! ("The maximum {}", max);
  ```

2.  Write the `maximum` function that returns the maximum element of `v`.

  ```rust
  let v = [1,2,4,5,23,54,6,7,34,6,6,3];
  let max = maximum (&v);
  
  println! ("The maximum {}", max);
  ```

  Hint: You have to send a refernce of `v` to the function.

---

# Closures

Similar to functions, but save context.

```rust
// types are inferred
let max = |a, b| { if a > b { a } else { b } }
// types are explicit
let min = |a: i32, b: i32| { if a < b { a } else { b } }
// there is only one expression
let sum = |a, b| { a + b }
```

Example

```rust
let sum = |a, b| a+b;

println! ("{}", sum (2, 3));
```

---

## Iterator filters

Closures are used for iterator, very much like in functional programming languages

### Filter
```rust 
iterator.filter_map (self, |element| => { /* ... */ })
```

### Find

```rust
ietartor.find_map (self, |element| -> bool => { /* ... */ })
```

### Fold

```rust
iterator.fold (self, |value: T, element| -> T => { /* ... */ })
```

---

# Workpoint 8 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint_extra.mp3"></span>)

Assign to `max` the value of the maximum number in the array. Use the `functional` programming style.

```rust
let v = [1,2,4,5,23,54,6,7,34,6,6,3];
let max = ...

println! ("The maximum {}", max);
```

Remeber array slices are iterators that return references to array elements.

---


# Modules

1. `mod` statement

  ```rust
  mod security {
      fn secure () {
        // ...
      }
  }

  fn main () {
      security::secure ();
  }
  ```

  Why does it not compile?

2.  `mod` source

  ```rust
  mod security; // <- loads module from security.rs

  fn main () {
      security::secure ();
  }
  ```

---

# The standard library

## Importing modules

  - `use` statements may be placed anywhere
  - they are valid inside the context where the were imported

```rust
use module::submodule;

use module::submodule::APublicType;

use module::submodule::{APublicType, AnotherPublicType, self}
```

## Equivalent of libc

Rust has a standard library, more or less equivalent to the libc

```rust
/* this is imported by default *.
use std;
```
---

# Enum

- An enum, or "sum type", is a way to express some data that may be one of several things.
- Similar to the union type in C
- Much more powerful than in Java, C, C++, C#...
- Each enum variant can have optional payloads:
    - no data (unit variant)
    - named data (struct variant)
    - unnamed ordered data (tuple variant)

```rust
enum Resultish {
    Ok,
    Warning { code: i32, message: String },
    Err(String)
}
```

.card[.small[.center[![Enum](../images/sep_enum.png)]]]

---
class: split-70
# Enum `match`-ing

- Enum variants are namespaced by their enum type: `Resultish::Ok`.
    - You can import all variants with `use Resultish::*`.
- Enums, much as you'd expect, can be matched on like any other data type.

.column[
```rust
match make_request() {
    Resultish::Ok =>
        println!("Success!"),
    Resultish::Warning { code, message } =>
        println!("Warning: {}!", message),
    Resultish::Err(s) =>
        println!("Failed with error: {}", s),
}
```
]

.card[.small_vertical[.center[![Enum](../images/sep_match_example.png)]]]
]

class: split-70

# `Option` .top_image[![Seatbelt](../images/seatbelt.png)] 

- Rust has no NULL type
- a variable of a type has to store a value of that actual type
- a reference has to exist and point to a valid memory

Use `Option` enum

.column[
```rust
enum Option<T> {
  Some(T)
  None,
}
```

T is any valid type
]

.column[
.card[.small_vertical[.center[![Option](../images/sep_option.png)]]]
]

---

## `Option` example

Rust automatically imports  `Option::*`

```rust
fn integer_division (a:isize, b: isize) -> Option<isize> {
  if b == 0 {
    None
  } else {
    Some(a / b)
  }
}

fn main () {
  let x = 120;
  let y = 7;
  match integer_division (x, y) {
    Some(d) => println! ("{}:{} = {}", x, y, d),
    None => println! ("division by 0")
  };
}
```

---
# Workpoint 9 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] (<span class="workpoint" seconds="300" music="../music/workpoint.mp3"></span>)

Write the factorial (n!) function without panicing if the computation is not possible. Use one single `println!`.

```rust
fn factorial (n: i32) -> Option<u32> {
  match n {
    _ => unimplemented!()
  }
}

fn main () {
  println! ("10!: {} 0!: {} -10!: {}", factorial(10), factorial(0), factorial(-10));
  // prints 10!: 3628800, 0!: 0, 10!: not possible
}
```

Hint: take a look at `if let`.

---

# Whats next?

  - Structures
  - Traits
  - Generics

---

# Why did we get an error at `println!`? 

The Rust macro system is a language extension:
  - correct syntax
  - must be a valid AST element

Macro definition example:

```rust
macro_rules! the_macro {
  /* pattern 1*/
  () => {{
      ...
  }}
  /* pattern 2*/
  () => {{
      ...
  }}
  // ...
}
```

1. The pattren is made out of valid AST elements
2. You can _run_ some code while you parse macros

Is this possible in the C/C++ language?

---

```
---

## A quick overview of macro Patterns

### Repetitions

Very similar to regular expressions


 - `*` â€” indicates any number of repetitions.
 - `+` â€” indicates any number but at least one.
 - `?` â€” indicates an optional fragment with zero or one occurrences.

```rust
macro_rules! print_them {
  (($i:ident,)* ) => { $( println! ("{}", $i);)* }
}

Write the `printf` macro
 1. write the definition
 2. write the implementation

```rust
macro_rules! printf {
  () => { /* ... */ }
}

fn main () {
  let firstname = "your first name";
  let lastname = "your last name";
  printf! (firstname); // <--- this line should not compile
  printf! ("Hello from Rust");
  printf! ("Hello, my name is {}", firstname);
  printf! ("Hello, my full name is {} {}", firstname, lastname);
  printf! ("Hello, my full name is {}", format! ("{}", firstname, lastname));
}
```

Hint: use `print!` and the `tt` item type as a wildcard
