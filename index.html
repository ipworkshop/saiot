# Team

### Course & Labs
- Alexandru Radovici
- Alexandru Vaduva (Yocto), Siemens Romania

### Materials
- Ioana Culic

### Tock Support
- Teona Severin
- Cosmin Radu

---

# Software

- [Wyliodrin STUDIO](https://wyliodrin.studio) - development software
- [Docker for Linux](link to dockerhub) - development software
- one of the available kits

### Linux
Use any distribution that can run docker

### Windows
WSL also works, probably Ubuntu is the right choice

### macOS
Virtual Machine?

<!-- - [Virtual Machine](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1thj-DwDWb8MgghW5rzOR6kRyGjY6G3xI) with all the software preinstalled
- [Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hpJ2yysqKzfFEASeAWWFqKNST5CQ7XY7/view?usp=sharing) for setting up the software -->
