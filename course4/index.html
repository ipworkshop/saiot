# Overview

1. Tock Development Environment
2. Tock
3. Applications

---

# Development Environment

You will have to install:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - a powerfull source code editor 
    - [RLS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust) - the Rust extension
    - [Remote SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh-tutorial) - the connection to the virtual machine

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - a Linux environment&sup1; with the Tock setup
  - [Extension Pack](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.12/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-6.1.12.vbox-extpack) - you will be able to see you USB devices in guest virtual machine

- [Tock Virtual Machine](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1thj-DwDWb8MgghW5rzOR6kRyGjY6G3xI) - Import Appliance
    - Windows: Make sure you select __Allow__ when you get a question from the Firewall

&sup1;If you are running Linux, this step is recommended, not necessary.

---
## Virtual Box

1. Install the [Extension Pack](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.12/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-6.1.12.vbox-extpack)
2. Import Appliance [Tock-Dev](Tock-Dev.ova)



---
## Visual Studio Code

Setup the Extensions:
  - [RLS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust) - the Rust extension
  - [Remote SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh-tutorial) - the connection to the virtual machine

.center[.title[![Remote SHH Link](../images/vscode_ssh.png)]]

---

### SSH connect

1. Start the Virtual Machine with Tock
2. Connect to host: `tock@localhost:2000`&sup1; (password: `tock`)

.center[.title[![Remote SHH Link](../images/vscode_ssh_link.png)]]

&sup1; Due to an issue with the Remote SSH Extension, you will always have to write `tock@localhost:2000`, it will not be remebered.

# Tock

- A <b>preemptive</b> embedded OS (runs on MCUs)
  - Cortex-M
  - RISC-V
- Uses memory protection (MPU required)
- Has separate <b>kernel and user space</b>
  - most embedded OS have the one piece software philosophy
- Runs untrusted apps in user space
- <b>Microkernel</b> architecture
- Kernel (and drivers) written in Rust
- Apps written in C/C++ or Rust (any language that can be compiled)

+-- /tock-posix           # our Tock version (with POSIX emulation)
|   +-- tock                # kernel
|   +-- libtock-c           # C userspace
```

# Workpoint 3 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

1. Write and upload and app that faults. Use `tockloader`.
```c
int main(void)
{
      int *s = NULL;
      *s = 0;
      return 0;
}
```

2. Upload the `blink` app using `tockloader`.
 - Does it work? Explain.

3. Modify the app fault policy so that it does not panic when an app faults
  - hint: `main.rs` serach for `FAULT_RESPONSE`.

Use the proecess console to show the details for the apps.

# Scheduler

The `Scheduler` trait

- Round Robun
- Cooperative
- Priority Queue

```rust
/// Trait which any scheduler must implement.
pub trait Scheduler<C: Chip> {
    /// Decide which process to run next.
    ///
    /// The scheduler must decide whether to run a process, and if so, which one.
    /// If the scheduler chooses not to run a process, it can request that the chip
    /// enter sleep mode.
    fn next(&self, kernel: &Kernel) -> SchedulingDecision;

    /// Inform the scheduler of why the last process stopped executing, and how
    /// long it executed for. Notably, `execution_time_us` will be `None`
    /// if the the scheduler requested this process be run cooperatively.

    /// and dynamic deferred calls. Most schedulers will use this default
    /// implementation, but schedulers which at times wish to defer interrupt
    /// handling will reimplement it.
    ///
    /// Providing this interface allows schedulers to fully manage how
    /// the main kernel loop executes. For example, a more advanced
    /// scheduler that attempts to help processes meet their deadlines may
    /// need to defer bottom half interrupt handling or to selectively service
    /// certain interrupts. Or, a power aware scheduler may want to selectively
    /// choose what work to complete at any time to meet power requirements.

.card[.small[![memop](../images/sep_memop.png)]]
.card[.small[![returncode](../images/sep_returncode.png)]]
]

---

## 0: Yield

Yield transitions the current process from the Running to the Yielded state, and
the process will not execute again until another callback re-schedules the
process.

If a process has enqueued callbacks waiting to execute when Yield is called, the
process immediately re-enters the Running state and the first callback runs.

```rust
yield()
```

##### Arguments

None.

##### Return

None.

---

## 1: Subscribe

Subscribe assigns callback functions to be executed in response to various
events.
- a callback function has a *callback ID* (`driver`,`subscribe_number`), 
- null pointer disables the callback

```rust
subscribe(driver: u32, subscribe_number: u32, callback: u32, userdata: u32) -> ReturnCode as u32
```

##### Arguments

 - `driver`: An integer specifying which driver to call.
 - `subscribe_number`: An integer index for which function is being subscribed.
 - `callback`: A pointer to a callback function to be executed when this event
 occurs. `void callback(int arg1, int arg2, int arg3, void* data)`.
 - `userdata`: A pointer to a value of any type that will be passed back

##### Return

 - `ENODEVICE` if `driver` does not refer to a valid kernel driver.
 - `ENOSUPPORT` if the driver exists but doesn't support the `subscribe_number`.
 - Other return codes based on the specific driver.

---

## 2: Command

Command instructs the driver to perform a specific action.

```rust
command(driver: u32, command_number: u32, argument1: u32, argument2: u32) -> ReturnCode as u32
```

#### Arguments

 - `driver`: An integer specifying which driver to call.
 - `command_number`: An integer specifying the requested command.
 - `argument1`: A command-specific argument.
 - `argument2`: A command-specific argument.

- One Tock convention with the Command syscall is that command number 0 will
always return a value of 0 or greater if the driver is supported.

#### Return

 - `ENODEVICE` if `driver` does not refer to a valid kernel driver.
 - `ENOSUPPORT` if the driver exists but doesn't support the `command_number`.
 - Other return codes based on the specific driver.

---

## 3: Allow

Allow shares memory buffers between the kernel and application.
- null pointer revokes sharing a region.

```rust
allow(driver: u32, allow_number: u32, pointer: usize, size: u32) -> ReturnCode as u32
```

#### Arguments

 - `driver`: An integer specifying which driver should be granted access.
 - `allow_number`: A driver-specific integer specifying the purpose of this
   buffer.
 - `pointer`: A pointer to the start of the buffer in the process memory space.
 - `size`: An integer number of bytes specifying the length of the buffer.

#### Return

 - `ENODEVICE` if `driver` does not refer to a valid kernel driver.
 - `ENOSUPPORT` if the driver exists but doesn't support the `allow_number`.
 - `EINVAL` the buffer referred to by `pointer` and `size` lies completely or
partially outside of the processes addressable RAM.
 - Other return codes based on the specific driver.

---

## 4: Memop

Memop expands the memory segment available to the process, allows the process to
retrieve pointers to its allocated memory space, provides a mechanism for
the process to tell the kernel where its stack and heap start, and other
operations involving process memory.

```rust
memop(op_type: u32, argument: u32) -> [[ VARIES ]] as u32
```

#### Arguments

 - `op_type`: An integer indicating whether this is a `brk` (0), a `sbrk` (1),
   or another memop call.
 - `argument`: The argument to `brk`, `sbrk`, or other call.

Each memop operation is specific and details of each call can be found in
the [memop syscall documentation](syscalls/memop.md).

#### Return

- Dependent on the particular memop call.

# Workpoint 4 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Enable the system calls trace in `kernel/src/config.rs`. 
1. Upload and app that prints a text on the shell using `printf`. 
  - How many system calls is printf using?
  - What is the driver number of the driver used for printing?

2. Upload the blink app and look at the system calls trace.
  - What is led's driver number?

---
## Hello Driver

Kernel

1. Write the `Hello` and its implementation
2. Implement the `Driver` trait for `Hello`
  - all methiods have default implementation
3. Add the driver to the board structure in `main.rs`

User space

- Implement the system calls

---
### Kernel

Write the driver and implement the `Driver` trait (1 and 2).

Write a file `hello.rs` in the same folder as `main.rs`.

```rust
use kernel::{Driver, AppId, ReturnCode};

/// Each driver is identified by a unique number
///
/// numbers higher than 0xa0000000 are unused by standard drivers
pub const DRIVER_NUM: usize = 0xa0000000;

/// The Hello structure
pub struct Hello {}


/// The hello implementation
impl Hello {
    pub fn new() -> Hello {
        Hello {}
    }
}

/// The driver system calls implementation
impl Driver for Hello {
    /// subscribe and allow will use the default implementation

    /// command syscall
    fn command(&self, command_num: usize, _data1: usize, _data2: usize, _app_id: AppId) -> ReturnCode {
        match command_num {
            // command_num 0 is used to verify if the driver exists
            0 => ReturnCode::SUCCESS,

            // the command number is not defined
            _ => ReturnCode::ENOSUPPORT,
        }
    }
}
```

---
### Kernel

Register the driver for in the board's structure (3)

In `main.rs` 

```rust
/// use the driver module
mod hello;

// ...

### User space

In your application's folder

hello.h
```c
#pargma once

#define HELLO_DRIVER_NUMBER 0xa0000000

bool hello_is_available (void);

```

hello.c
```c
#include "hello.h"
#include <tock.h>

bool hello_is_available (void) {
    if (command (HELLO_DRIVER_NUMBER, 0, 0, 0) == TOCK_SUCCESS) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Workpoint 5 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Add `command_num` 1 to the driver and print a text on the shell when it is called.

```rust
/// The driver system calls implementation
impl Driver for Hello {
    /// subscribe and allow will use the default implementation

    /// command syscall
    fn command(&self, command_num: usize, _data1: usize, _data2: usize, _app_id: AppId) -> ReturnCode {
        match command_num {
            // command_num 0 is used to verify if the driver exists
            0 => ReturnCode::SUCCESS,
            1 => // ...

            // the command number is not defined
            _ => ReturnCode::ENOSUPPORT,
        }
    }
}
```

Add a function for it in the header and source file in userspace. 
Write and upload an app that userspac the driver.

---
## Workpoint 6 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Add `command_num` 2 that will increment a counter and return it to the app.
  Hint: use `ReturnCode::SuccessWithValue { value: ... }`

Each time the app calls the system call, the driver will will return an incremented number.

```c
#include "hello.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <timer.h>

int nr;

int main(void) {
    while (true) {
        nr = hello_counter ();
        printf ("Counter %d\n", n);
        delay_ms (1000);
    }
}
```

Hint: store the current number in the `Hello` structure.

# Mutability

All Tock traits use `&self` to be able to share a driver with several other drivers.

Interior mutability:
- Cell<T> (`core::cell::Cell`)
- OptionalCell<T> (`kernel::common:cells::OptionalCell`)
- TakeCell<T> (`kernel::common::cells::TakeCell`)

.right[
.card[.small_vertical[![Cell](../images/sep_cell.png)]]
.card[.small_vertical[![OptionalCell](../images/sep_optionalcell.png)]]
.card[.small_vertical[![TakeCell](../images/sep_takecell.png)]]
]

---

## Cell

Store a mutable value inside a immutable structure

```rust
use kernel::{Driver, AppId, ReturnCode};
use core::cell::Cell;

/// Each driver is identified by a unique number
///
/// numbers higher than 0xa0000000 are unused by standard drivers
pub const DRIVER_NUM: usize = 0xa0000000;

/// The Hello structure
pub struct Hello {
    nr: Cell<usize>
}


/// The hello implementation
impl Hello {
    pub fn new() -> Hello {
        Hello {
            nr: Cell::new (0)
        }
    }
}

/// The driver system calls implementation
impl Driver for Hello {
    /// subscribe and allow will use the default implementation

    /// command syscall
    fn command(&self, command_num: usize, _data1: usize, _data2: usize, _app_id: AppId) -> ReturnCode {
        match command_num {
            // command_num 0 is used to verify if the driver exists
            0 => ReturnCode::SUCCESS,

            2 => {
                // modify number
                self.nr.set (self.nr.get () + 1);
                ReturnCode::SuccessWithValue { value: self.nr.get() }
            }

            // the command number is not defined
            _ => ReturnCode::ENOSUPPORT,
        }
    }
}
```
