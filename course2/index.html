# Workpoint review

Solution from 

```rust
fn factorial (n: i32) -> Option<u32> {
  if n < 0 {
        return None
  }
  
  match factorial(n-1) {
      Some(value) => Some(value * (n as u32)),
      None => Some(1)
  }
}

fn map(option: Option<u32>) -> String {
    match option {
        Some(value) => value.to_string(),
        None => "not possible".to_string()
    }
}

fn main () {
  println! ("10!: {}, 0!: {}, -10!: {}", map(factorial(10)), map(factorial(0)), map(factorial(-10)));
  // prints 10!: 3628800, 0!: 0, 10!: not possible
}
```

---
# Structures

- A struct declaration:
    - Fields are declared with `name: type`.

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
```

- By convention, structs have `CamelCase` names, and their fields have `snake_case` names.
- Structs may be instantiated with fields assigned in braces.

```rust
let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };
```

Note: this is stack allocated, it is not a on the heap

---
## Structures access

- Struct fields may be accessed with dot notation.
- Structs may not be partially-initialized.
    - You must assign all fields upon creation, or declare an uninitialized
      struct that you initialize later.

```rust
let mut p = Point { x: 19, y: 8 };
p.x += 1;
p.y -= 1;
```

---


## Structures mutability

- Structs do not have field-level mutability.
- Mutability is a property of the **variable binding**, not the type.

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    mut y: i32, // Illegal!
}
```

---
## Structures privacy

- Structs are namespaced with their module name.
    - The fully qualified name of `Point` is `foo::Point`.
- Struct fields are private by default.
    - They may be made public with the `pub` keyword.
- Private fields may only be accessed from within the module where the struct is
    declared.

```rust
mod foo {
    pub struct Point {
        pub x: i32,
        y: i32,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let b = foo::Point { x: 12, y: 12 };
}
```

.bottom_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)] Fix the example!

---
## Structures instantiation

```rust
mod foo {
    pub struct Point {
        pub x: i32,
        y: i32,
    }

    // Creates and returns a new point
    pub fn new(x: i32, y: i32) -> Point {
        Point { x: x, y: y }
    }
}
```

- `new` is inside the same module as `Point`, so accessing private fields is
  allowed.
- `new` is not a keywork in rust

---
## Structures `match`ing

- Destructure structs with `match` statements.

```rust
pub struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

match p {
    Point { x, y } => println!("({}, {})", x, y)
}
```

---
## Structures `match`ing

- Some other tricks for struct `match`es:

```rust
match p {
    Point { y: y1, x: x1 } => println!("({}, {})", x1, y1)
}

match p {
    Point { y, .. } => println!("{}", y)
}
```
- Fields do not need to be in order.
- List fields inside braces to bind struct members to those variable names.
    - Use `struct_field: new_var_binding` to change the variable it's bound to.
- Omit fields: use `..` to ignore all unnamed fields.

---
## Structures Update Syntax

- A struct initializer can contain `.. s` to copy some or all fields from `s`.
- Any fields you don't specify in the initializer get copied over from the target struct.
- The struct used must be of the same type as the target struct.
    - No copying same-type fields from different-type structs!

```rust
struct Foo { a: i32, b: i32, c: i32, d: i32, e: i32 }

let mut x = Foo { a: 1, b: 1, c: 2, d: 2, e: 3 };
let x2 = Foo { e: 4, .. x };

// Useful to update multiple fields of the same struct:
x = Foo { a: 2, b: 2, e: 2, .. x };
```

---
## Tuple Structs

- Variant on structs that has a name, but no named fields.
- Have numbered field accessors, like tuples (e.g. `x.0`, `x.1`, etc).
- Can also `match` these.

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);

let mut c = Color(0, 255, 255);
c.0 = 255;
match c {
    Color(r, g, b) => println!("({}, {}, {})", r, g, b)
}
```

---
## Workpoint 1 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Print the structure elements:
  1. by directly accessing them via `.`
  2. using `match`

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);

let mut c = Color(0, 255, 255);
println!("({}, {}, {})", ..., ..., ...)
```

---
## Tuple Structs

- Helpful if you want to create a new type that's not just an alias.
    - This is often referred to as the "newtype" pattern.
- These two types are structurally identical, but not equatable.

```rust
// Not equatable
struct Meters(i32);
struct Yards(i32);

// May be compared using `==`, added with `+`, etc.
type MetersAlias = i32;
type YardsAlias  = i32;
```

---
## Unit Structs (Zero-Sized Types)

- Structs can be declared to have zero size.
    - This struct has no fields!
- We can still instantiate it.
- It can be used as a "marker" type on other data structures.
    - Useful to indicate, e.g., the type of data a container is storing.

```rust
struct Unit;

let u = Unit;
```

---
## Methods

```rust
impl Point {
    pub fn distance(&self, other: Point) -> f32 {
        let (dx, dy) = (self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y);
        ((dx.pow(2) + dy.pow(2)) as f32).sqrt()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
    p.distance();
}
```

- Methods can be implemented for structs in an `impl` block.
- Like fields, methods may be accessed via dot notation.
- Can be made public with `pub`.
    - `impl` blocks themselves don't need to be made `pub`.

---
## Methods `self` mutability

```rust
impl Point {
    fn distance(&self, other: Point) -> f32 {
        let (dx, dy) = (self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y);
        ((dx.pow(2) + dy.pow(2)) as f32).sqrt()
    }

    fn translate(&mut self, x: i32, y: i32) {
        self.x += x;
        self.y += y;
    }

    fn mirror_y(self) -> Point {
        Point { x: -self.x, y: self.y }
    }
}
```

- `distance` needs to access but not modify fields.
- `translate` modifies the struct fields.
- `mirror_y` returns an entirely new struct, consuming the old one.

---
## Associated Functions

```rust
impl Point {
    fn new(x: i32, y: i32) -> Point {
        Point { x: x, y: y }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point::new(1, 2);
}
```

- Associated function: like a method, but does not take `self`.
    - This is called with namespacing syntax: `Point::new()`.
        - Not `Point.new()`.
    - Like a "static" method in Java.
- A constructor-like function is usually named `new`.
    - No inherent notion of constructors, no automatic construction.

---

# Workpoint 2 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Write the implementation for the Professor struct

```rust
struct Person {
  firstname: String,
  lastname: String,
  age: usize,
}

impl Person {
  // new function
  // setters for properties
}

fn main () {
  let p = Person::new ("The".to_string(), String::from("Name"), 9);
  p.set_firstname ("New".to_string());
  println! ("{} {} is now {}", p.firstname, p.lastname, p.age);
}
```

There are lots of adaptations to be done for this.

# Traits


- Similar to interfaces in Java
- Methods that types have to implement

.column[
```rust
struct Professor {
  firstname: String,
  lastname: String,
  age: usize,
  // add subjects
}

trait Person {
  fn get_name (&self) -> String;
  fn get_job (&self) -> String;
}

impl Person for Professor {
  fn get_name (&self) -> String {
    // ...
  }

  fn get_job (&self) -> String {
    // ...
  }
}
```
]

.column[
.card[.small_vertical[.center[![Struct](../images/sep_struct.png)]]]
]

---

# Workpoint 3 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Implement `Person` for `Professor` and `Student`

```rust
struct Professor {
  firstname: String,
  lastname: String,
  age: usize,
}

struct Student {
  firstname: String,
  lastname: String,
  age: usize,
}

trait Person {
  fn get_name (&self) -> String;
  fn get_job (&self) -> String;
}

fn main () {
  // make a student
  let p = Professor::new (String::from("John"), String::from("Doe"), 20);
  let s = Student::new ("Johnny".to_string(), "Doe".to_string(), 50);
  // make a professor
  println! ("{:?}", p);
  println! ("{:?}", s);

  println! ("{} is a {}", p.get_name (), p.get_job());
  println! ("{} is a {}", s.get_name (), s.get_job());
}
```

Hint: to copy a string, getv a `str` and use the `to_string` method.

---

# Workpoint 4 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Make the source code work:

```rust
struct Complex {
    r: f64,
    i: f64
}

fn main () {
    let n1 = Complex::new (2, 3);
    let n2 = Complex::new (-2, 3);
    let n3 = Complex::new (2, -3);
    let n4 = Complex::new (3, 0);
    let n5 = Complex::new (0, 3);

    println! ("The number is {}", n1); // prints 2+3i
    println! ("The number is {}", n2); // prints -2+3i
    println! ("The number is {}", n3); // prints 2-3i
    println! ("The number is {}", n4); // prints 3
    println! ("The number is {}", n5); // prints 3i

    println! ("The number is {}", n1-n1); // prints 0
    println! ("The number is {}", n1+n2); 
    println! ("The number is {}", n1-n2);
    println! ("The number is {}", n1*n2);
    println! ("The number is {}", n1/n2);
}
```
  - Hint: use the Display, Add, Sub, Mul and Div traits. 
  - Read the compiler hints carefully.

---
# Deriving

- Many traits are so straightforward that the compiler can often implement them
  for you.
- A `#[derive(...)]` attribute tells the compiler to insert a default
  implementation for whatever traits you tell it to.
- This removes the tedium of repeatedly manually implementing traits like `Clone` yourself!

```rust
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Debug)]
struct Complex {
    r: f64,
    i: f64
}
```

---
## Derivable Traits

- You can derive the following core traits:
    - `Clone`, `Copy`, `Debug`, `Default`, `Eq`,
    - `Hash`, `Ord`, `PartialEq`, `PartialOrd`.
- Deriving custom traits is also supported! (e.g. see [`serde`](https://serde.rs/) and [`diesel`](http://diesel.rs/))
- Careful: deriving a trait won't always work.
    - Can only derive a trait on a data type when all of its members can have derived the trait.
    - e.g., `Eq` can't be derived on a struct containing only `f32`s, since
      `f32` is not `Eq`.

---
## Core traits

- It's good to be familiar with the core traits.
    - `Clone`, `Copy`
    - `Debug`
    - `Default`
    - `Eq`, `PartialEq`
    - `Hash`
    - `Ord`, `PartialOrd`

---
### Clone

```rust
pub trait Clone: Sized {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self;

    fn clone_from(&mut self, source: &Self) { ... }
}
```
- A trait which defines how to duplicate a value of type `T`.
- This can solve ownership problems.
    - You can clone an object rather than taking ownership or borrowing!
- [Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html)

---
### Clone

```rust
#[derive(Clone)] // without this, Bar cannot derive Clone.
struct Foo {
    x: i32,
}

#[derive(Clone)]
struct Bar {
    x: Foo,
}
```

---
### Copy
```rust
pub trait Copy: Clone { }
```
- `Copy` denotes that a type has "copy semantics" instead of "move semantics."
- Type must be able to be copied by copying bits (`memcpy`).
    - Types that contain references _cannot_ be `Copy`.
- Marker trait: does not implement any methods, but defines behavior instead.
- [Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html)

---
### Debug

```rust
pub trait Debug {
    fn fmt(&self, &mut Formatter) -> Result;
}
```

- Defines output for the `{:?}` formatting option.
- Generates debug output, not pretty printed.
- Generally speaking, you should always derive this trait.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };
println!("The origin is: {:?}", origin);
// The origin is: Point { x: 0, y: 0 }
```
- [Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html)

---
### Default

```rust
pub trait Default: Sized {
    fn default() -> Self;
}
```
- Defines a default value for a type.
- Often can be derived, but sometimes it has to be implemented explicitly.
- [Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/default/trait.Default.html)

---
### Eq vs. PartialEq

```rust
pub trait PartialEq<Rhs: ?Sized = Self> {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool;

    // example of default trait method implementation
    fn ne(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool { 
        !self.eq (other)
    }
}

pub trait Eq: PartialEq<Self> {}
```
- Traits for defining equality via the `==` operator.

---
### Eq vs. PartialEq

- `PartialEq` represents a _partial equivalence relation_.
    - Symmetric: if a == b then b == a
    - Transitive: if a == b and b == c then a == c
- `ne` has a default implementation in terms of `eq`.
- `Eq` represents a _total equivalence relation_.
    - Symmetric: if a == b then b == a
    - Transitive: if a == b and b == c then a == c
    - **Reflexive: a == a**
- `Eq` does not define any additional methods.
    - (It is also a Marker trait.)
- For example, in floating point numbers `NaN != NaN`,
    so floating point types implement `PartialEq` but not `Eq`.

---
### Ord vs. PartialOrd

```rust
pub trait PartialOrd<Rhs: ?Sized = Self>: PartialEq<Rhs> {
    // Ordering is one of Less, Equal, Greater
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Rhs) -> Option<Ordering>;

    fn lt(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool { ... }
    fn le(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool { ... }
    fn gt(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool { ... }
    fn ge(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool { ... }
}
```
- Traits for values that can be compared for a sort-order.

---
### Ord vs. PartialOrd

- The comparison must satisfy, for all `a`, `b` and `c`:
  - Antisymmetry: if `a < b` then `!(a > b)`, as well as `a > b` implying `!(a < b)`; and
  - Transitivity: `a < b` and `b < c` implies `a < c`. The same must hold for both `==` and `>`.
- `lt`, `le`, `gt`, `ge` have default implementations based on `partial_cmp`.

---
### Ord vs. PartialOrd

```rust
pub trait Ord: Eq + PartialOrd<Self> {
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering;
}
```
- Trait for types that form a total order.
- An order is a total order if it is (for all `a`, `b` and `c`):
  - total and antisymmetric: exactly one of `a < b`, `a == b` or `a > b` is true; and
  - transitive, `a < b` and `b < c` implies `a < c`. The same must hold for both `==` and `>`.
- For example, for floating point numbers, `NaN < 0 == false` and `NaN >= 0 == false` (cf. IEEE 754-2008 section 5.11).
- See `std::cmp` [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/index.html) for more information.

---
### Hash

```rust
pub trait Hash {
    fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H);

    fn hash_slice<H: Hasher>(data: &[Self], state: &mut H)
        where Self: Sized { ... }
}
```
- A hashable type.
- The `H` type parameter is an abstract hash state used to compute the hash.
- If you also implement `Eq`, there is an additional, important property:
```rust
k1 == k2 -> hash(k1) == hash(k2)
```
- [Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/hash/trait.Hash.html)

---

# Workpoint 5 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Make the source code work:

```rust
struct Complex {
    r: f64,
    i: f64
}

fn main () {
    let n1 = Complex::new (2, 3);
    let n2 = Complex::new (-2, 3);
    let n3 = Complex::new (2, -3);
    let n4 = Complex::new (3, 0);
    let n5 = Complex::new (0, 3);

    println! ("The number is {}", n1); // prints 2+3i
    println! ("The number is {}", n2); // prints -2+3i
    println! ("The number is {}", n3); // prints 2-3i
    println! ("The number is {}", n4); // prints 3
    println! ("The number is {}", n5); // prints 3i

    println! ("The number is {}", n1-n1); // prints 0
    println! ("The number is {}", n1+n2); 
    println! ("The number is {}", n1-n2);
    println! ("The number is {}", n1*n2);
    println! ("The number is {}", n1/n2);
    println! ("The numbers {} and {} are {}", n1, n2, if n1==n2 { "equal"} else {"not equal"});
}
```
  - Hint: use the source from the previous workpoint, look at the `PartialEq` traits. 
  - Read the compiler hints carefully.

---

# Workpoint 6 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Find a way to order these numbers and make the source work.
```rust
struct Complex {
    r: f64,
    i: f64
}

fn main () {
    let n1 = Complex::new (2, 3);
    let n2 = Complex::new (-2, 3);

    println! ("The number is {}", n1); // prints 2+3i
    println! ("The number is {}", n2); // prints -2+3i

    println! ("The number is {}", n1<n2);
    println! ("The number is {}", n1<=n2); 
    println! ("The number is {}", n1>n2);
    println! ("The number is {}", n1>=n2);
}
```

---

# References 

- Reference *types* are written with an `&`: `&i32`.
- References can be taken with `&` (like C/C++).
- References can be _dereferenced_ with `*` (like C/C++).
- References are guaranteed to be valid.
    - Validity is enforced through compile-time checks!
- These are *not* the same as pointers!
- Reference lifetimes are pretty complex, as we'll explore later.

```rust
let x = 12;
let ref_x = &x;
println!("{}", *ref_x); // 12
```

---

# Ownership & Borrowing

- Explicit ownership is the biggest new feature that Rust brings to the table!
- Ownership is all (well, mostly) checked at compile time!
- Newcomers to Rust often find themselves "fighting with the borrow checker"
   trying to get their code to compile
- The ownership model is the biggest thing that Rust brings to the table, its
  claim to fame.
- Ownership is something that's checked at compile time and has as little
  runtime cost as possible.
- So it's zero (or very little) runtime cost, but you pay for it with a longer
  compilation time and learning curve. Which is where the phrase "fighitng with
  the borrow checker" comes from, when you have to work around the compiler's
  restrictions to figure out how to do what you want.

---
## Ownership

- A variable binding _takes ownership_ of its data.
    - A piece of data can only have one owner at a time.
- When a binding goes out of scope, the bound data is released automatically. (`Drop` trait)
    - For heap-allocated data, this means de-allocation.
- Data _must be guaranteed_ to outlive its references.

```rust
fn foo() {
    // Creates a String
    // Gives ownership of the String object to s
    let s = String::new ("This text is owned by s");

    // At the end of the scope, s goes out of scope.
    // s still owns the String object, so it can be cleaned up.
}
```

---
## Ownership

So here are the basics.
- When you introduce a variable binding, it takes ownership of its data. And a
  piece of data can only have one owner at a time.
- When a variable binding goes out of scope, nothing has access to the data
  anymore, so it can be released. Which means, if it's on the heap, it can be
  de-allocated.
- And data must be guaranteed to outlive its references. Or, all references are
  guaranteed to be valid.

---
## Move Semantics

```rust
let s1 = String::from ("A string");

// Ownership of the String object moves to s2.
let s2 = s1;

println!("{}", s1); // error: use of moved value `s1`
```

- `let s2 = s1;`
    - We don't want to copy the data, since that's expensive.
    - The data cannot have multiple owners.
    - Solution: move the String's ownership into `s2`, and declare `s1` invalid.
- `println!("{}", s1);`
    - We know that `s1` is no longer a valid variable binding, so this is an error.
- Rust can reason about this at compile time, so it throws a compiler error.

---
## Move Semantics

- Moving ownership copies data. BUT:
    - Often moves are optimized out by compiler.
    - When we move ownership of a heap allocated data (e.g. `String`), we do
        not touch data on heap, just few bytes allocated on stack are copied
        (pointer to heap, length and capacity; 24 bytes on 64-bit machine)
- Moves are automatic (via assignments); no need to use something like C++'s
  `std::move`.
    - However, there are functions like `std::mem::replace` in Rust to provide
      advanced ownership management.
- For more finer-grained control see standrard library functions:
`std::mem::replace`, `std::mem::swap` and others.

---
## Ownership

- Ownership does not always have to be moved.
- What would happen if it did? Rust would get very tedious to write:

```rust
fn string_length(s: String) -> String {
    // Do whatever here,
    // then return ownership of `s` back to the caller
}
```
- You could imagine that this does not scale well either.
    - The more variables you had to hand back, the longer your return type would be!
    - Imagine having to pass ownership around for 5+ variables at a time :(

```rust
fn string_length(s1: String, s2: String, ...) -> (String, String, ...) {
    // Do whatever here,
    // then return ownership of `s1`, `s2`, ... back to the caller
}
```
---
## Borrowing

- Instead of transferring ownership, we can _borrow_ data.
- A variable's data can be borrowed by taking a reference to the variable;
  ownership doesn't change.
    - When a reference goes out of scope, the borrow is over.
    - The original variable retains ownership throughout.

```rust
let s = String::from ("string");

// s_ref is a reference to s.
let s_ref = &s;

// use s_ref to access the data in the String s.
assert_eq!(s.chars().nth(1), s_ref.chars().nth(1));
```

Rust does automatic dereferencing.

---
## Borrowing

- Caveat: this adds restrictions to the original variable.
- Ownership cannot be transferred from a variable while references to it exist.
    - That would invalidate the reference.

```rust
let s = String::from("for borrow");

// s_ref is a reference to s.
let s_ref = &s;

// Moving ownership to s_new would invalidate s_ref.
// error: cannot move out of `s` because it is borrowed
let s_new = s;

println! ("{}", s_ref);
```

Try it without the `println!`

---
## Borrowing

```rust
/// `length` only needs `String` temporarily, so it is borrowed.
fn length(str_ref: &String) -> usize {
    // vec_ref is auto-dereferenced when you call methods on it.
    str_ref.len()
    // you can also explicitly dereference.
    // (*str_ref).len()
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::new ();
    length(&s);
    println!("{:?}", s); // this is fine
}
```
- Note the type of `length`: `str_ref` is passed by reference, so it's now an `&String`.
- References, like bindings, are *immutable* by default.
- The borrow is over after the reference goes out of scope (at the end of `length`).

---
## Borrowing

```rust
/// `push` needs to modify `string` so it is borrowed mutably.
fn push(str_ref: &mut String, x: &str) {
    str_ref.push_str (x);
}

fn main() {
    let mut s: String = String::from ("");
    let string_ref: &mut String = &mut s;
    push(string_ref, "str");
    assert_eq!(string_ref, "str");
}
```
- Variables can be borrowed by _mutable_ reference: `&mut string_ref`.
    - `string_ref` is a reference to a mutable `String`.
    - The type is `&mut String`, not `&String`.
- Different from a reference which is variable.

---
## Borrowing

```rust
/// `push` needs to modify `string` so it is borrowed mutably.
fn push2(str_ref: &mut String, x: &str) {
    // error: cannot move out of borrowed content.
    let string = *str_ref;
    string.push_str(x);
}

fn main() {
    let mut vector = String::from ("");
    push2(&mut string, "a new str");
}
```
- Error! You can't dereference `string_ref` into a variable binding because that
  would change the ownership of the data.

---
## Borrowing

- Rust will auto-dereference variables...
    - When making method calls on a reference.
    - When passing a reference as a function argument.

```rust
/// `length` only needs `s` temporarily, so it is borrowed.
fn length(s_ref: &&String) -> usize {
    // s_ref is auto-dereferenced when you call methods on it.
    s_ref.len()
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("");
    length(&&&&&&&&&&&&s);
}
```

---
## Borrowing

- You will have to dereference variables...
    - When writing into them.
    - And other times that usage may be ambiguous.

```rust
let mut a = 5;
let ref_a = &mut a;
*ref_a = 4;
println!("{}", *ref_a + 4);
// ==> 8
```

---
## `Copy` Types

- Rust defines a trait&sup1; named `Copy` that signifies that a type may be
    copied instead whenever it would be moved.
- Most primitive types are `Copy` (`i32`, `f64`, `char`, `bool`, etc.)
- Types that contain references may not be `Copy` (e.g. `Vec`, `String`).
```rust
let x: i32 = 12;
let y = x; // `i32` is `Copy`, so it's not moved :D
println!("x still works: {}, and so does y: {}", x, y);
```

&sup1; Like a Java/Go interface or Haskell typeclass


---
## Borrowing Rules
##### _The Holy Grail of Rust_
Learn these rules, and they will serve you well.

- You can't keep borrowing something after it stops existing.
- One object may have many immutable references to it (`&T`).
- **OR** _exactly one_ mutable reference (`&mut T`) (not both).
- That's it!

.card[.small[.center[![Borrow Rules](../images/sep_borrow_rules.png)]]]

---
### Borrowing Prevents...

- Iterator invalidation due to mutating a collection you're iterating over.
- This pattern can be written in C, C++, Java, Python, Javascript...
    - But may result in, e.g, `ConcurrentModificationException` (at runtime!)

```rust
let mut vs = [1,2,3,4];
for v in &vs {
    vs[1] = 3;
    println! ("{}", v);
    // ERROR: cannot borrow `vs` as mutable because
    // it is also borrowed as immutable
}
```

- `pop` needs to borrow `vs` as mutable in order to modify the data.
- But `vs` is being borrowed as immutable by the loop!

---
### Borrowing Prevents...

- Use-after-free
- Valid in C, C++...

```rust
let y: &i32;
{
    let x = 5;
    y = &x; // error: `x` does not live long enough
}
println!("{}", *y);
```

- The full error message:

```
error: `x` does not live long enough
note: reference must be valid for the block suffix following statement
    0 at 1:16
...but borrowed value is only valid for the block suffix
    following statement 0 at 4:18
```

- This eliminates a _huge_ number of memory safety bugs _at compile time_.
- As a side note, this technique of creating a block to limit the scope of a
variable (in this case x) is pretty useful.

---
### Borrowing Prevents...

- Data races in multithreaded environments.
- It checks at compile time if it's safe to share or send a given piece of data.
- Compiler ensures that programm uses necessary synchronization using various primitives: mutexes, atomics, channels, etc.
- NB: data races != race condition.
- Check out TRPL section of ["Fearless Concurrency"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-00-concurrency.html)

---
## Methods parameters

- The first argument to a method, named `self`, determines what kind of ownership the method
  requires.
- `&self`: the method *borrows* the value.
    - Use this unless you need a different ownership model.
- `&mut self`: the method *mutably borrows* the value.
    - The function needs to modify the struct it's called on.
- `self`: the method takes ownership.
    - The function consumes the value and may return something else.

---
# Generics

- This looks a lot like a standard library enum, `Result<T, E>`:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```
- `T` stands in for any generic type, not only `String`s.
- You can use any CamelCase identifier for generic types.

---
## Generic Structs

- Let's take a look at generic versions of several other structs from the last lecture:

```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}
```

---
## Generic Implementations

- To define implementations for structs & enums with generic types, declare the generics at the
    beginning of the `impl` block:

```rust
impl<T> Option<T> {
    fn is_some(&self) -> bool {
        match self {
            Result::Some(_) => true,
            Result::None => false,
        }
    }
}
```

---
## Generic Functions

- You can make a function generic over types as well.
- `<T, U>` declares the type parameters for `foo`.
    - `x: T, y: U` uses those type parameters.
- You can read this as "the function `foo`, for all types `T` and `U`,
    of two arguments: `x` of type `T` and `y` of type `U`."

```rust
fn foo<T, U>(x: T, y: U) {
    // ...
}
```

- But we can't do much with `x` and `y`, because we don't know anything
    about types `T` and `U`

---
## Generics with Trait Bounds

- Instead of allowing _literally any_ type, you can constrain generic types by
    _trait bounds_.
- This gives more power to generic functions & types.
- Trait bounds can be specified with `T: SomeTrait`, with a `where` clause,
    or with `impl Trait` in argument position.

```rust
fn digital_write<P: Pin>(p: &P, value: usize) {
    if value == 1 {
        p.set();
    } else {
        p.clear ();
    }
}

fn digital_write<P>(p: &P, value: usize) 
        where P: Pin {
    if value == 1 {
        p.set();
    } else {
        p.clear ();
    }
}

fn digital_write(p: &impl Pin, value: usize) {
    if value == 1 {
        p.set();
    } else {
        p.clear ();
    }
}

```

---
## Generics with Trait Bounds

- Multiple trait bounds are specified like `T: Clone + Ord`.
- There's no way (yet) to specify [negative trait bounds](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-mutually-exclusive-traits/2126).
  - e.g. you can't stipulate that a `T` must not be `Clone`.

```rust
fn digital_write<P: Output>(p: P, value: usize) {
   if value == 1 {
       p.set ();
   } else {
       p.clear ();
   }
}
```

---
## Generic Types With Trait Bounds

- You can also define structs with generic types and trait bounds.
- Be sure to declare all of your generic types in the struct header _and_ the
  impl block header.
- Only the impl block header needs to specify trait bounds.
    - This is useful if you want to have multiple impls for a struct each with
      different trait bounds

```rust
struct MyDriver<P: Pin> {
    pin1: &'static P,
    pin2: &'static P,
    // ...
}
```

---
## Generic Types With Trait Bounds

```rust
impl<P: Pin> Driver for MyDriver<P> {
   // ...
}
```

---
## Examples: Equality

```rust
// This is not the trait Rust actually uses for equality
trait Equals {
    fn equals(&self, other: &Self) -> bool;
}

impl<T: Equals, E: Equals> Equals for Result<T, E> {
    fn equals(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
        match (self, other) {
            (Ok(t1), Ok(t2)) => t1.equals(t2),
            (Err(e1), Err(e2)) => e1.equals(e2),
            _ => false
        }
    }
}
```
- `Self` is a special type which refers to the type of `self`.

---
## Inheritance (kinda)

- Some traits may require other traits to be implemented first.
    - e.g., `Eq` requires that `PartialEq` be implemented, and `Copy` requires `Clone`.
- Implementing the `Child` trait below requires you to also implement `Parent`.

```rust
trait Parent {
    fn foo(&self) {
        // ...
    }
}

trait Child: Parent {
    fn bar(&self) {
        self.foo();
        // ...
    }
}
```

---
# Lifetimes

- Lifetimes generally have a pretty steep learning curve.
- Don't worry if you don't understand these right away.

.title[.center[![Din Lac in Put](../images/mieuneli_din_lac_in_put.png)]]

---
## Lifetimes

- Imagine This:
  1. I acquire a resource.
  2. I lend you a reference to my resource.
  3. I decide that I'm done with the resource, so I deallocate it.
  4. You still hold a reference to the resource, and decide to use it.
  5. You crash 😿.
- We've already said that Rust makes this scenario impossible, but glossed over
    how.
- We need to prove to the compiler that _step 3_ will never happen before _step 4_.

---
## Lifetimes

- Lifetimes are used only together references
- All variables have a lifetime (usually hidden from the developer)
- All references are __have to__ be annotated with a lifetime
- Ordinarily, references have an implicit lifetime that we don't need to care
    about:

    ```rust
fn foo(x: &i32) {
    // ...
}
```
- However, we can explicitly provide one instead:
```rust
fn bar<'a>(x: &'a i32) {
    // ...
}
```

### Why lifetimes are useful?

How do you use free?

```c
// program: toad-barracuda-mammoth
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

char * without_first_word (char *s);

int main ()
{
    char * s = strdup ("ana has apples");
    char *wfw = without_first_word (s);
    // free (s);
    printf ("%s\n", wfw);
    // free (wfw);
}

```

    // free (wfw);
}

```

---
### Lifetime annotations

From a birds eye view, how should Rust free `s` and `wfw`?

```rust
fn without_first_word<'a> (s: &'a str) -> &'a str;

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("ana has apples"); 
    let wfw = without_first_word (&s);      
    // let t = s; // equivalent of free (s)
    println! ("{}", wfw);                  
    // let t = s; // equivalent of free (s)
}                                         
```


---
### This is why lifetimes are useful.

```rust
fn without_first_word<'a> (s: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    let mut pos = 0;
    for a in s.chars() {
        if a != ' ' { pos = pos + 1; }
        else { break; }
    }
    &s[pos..]
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("ana has apples");
    let wfw = without_first_word (&s);
    // let t = s; // equivalent of free (s)
    println! ("{}", wfw);
}
```

---
### Efective Lifetimes 

```rust
fn without_first_word<'a> (s: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    let mut pos = 0;
    for a in s.chars() {
        if a != ' ' { pos = pos + 1; }
        else { break; }
    }
    &s[pos..]
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("ana has apples"); // <--- s lifetime ('ls) starts here
    let wfw = without_first_word (&s);      // <--- wfw lifetime ('lwfw) starts here
    // let t = s; // equivalent of free (s)    // <--- s lifetime ('ls) ends here, wfw lifetime ('wfw) ends here (due to 'ls)
                                            //      t lifetime ('ts) starts here
    println! ("{}", wfw);                   // <--- wfw lifetime ('lwfw) actually ends here
}                                           // <--- t lifetime ('ts) ends here
```

---
### Lifetime annotations

```rust
fn without_first_word<'a> (s: &'a str) -> &'a str;

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("ana has apples"); // <--- s lifetime ('ls) starts here
    let wfw = without_first_word (&s);      // <--- wfw lifetime ('lwfw) starts here
    // let t = s; // equivalent of free (s)    // <--- s lifetime ('ls) ends here, wfw lifetime ('wfw) ends here (due to 'ls)
                                            //      t lifetime ('ts) starts here
    println! ("{}", wfw);                   // <--- wfw lifetime ('lwfw) actually ends here
}                                           // <--- t lifetime ('ts) ends here
```

---
### Multiple Lifetime Parameters

```c
// program: wolverine-mallard-gull
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

char * smaller (char *s1, char *s2) {
    if (strlen(s1) > strlen(s2)) return s2;
    else return s1;
}

int main () {
    char *s1 = strdup ("ip");
    char *s2 = strdup ("workshop");
    char *small = smaller (s1, s2);
    // free (s1);
    // free (s2);
    printf ("%s\n", small);
}

```

---
### Multiple Lifetime Parameters

```rust
fn smaller <'a> (s1: &'a str, s2: &'a str) -> &'a str {}

fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("ip"); 
    let s2 = String::from("workshop"); 
    let small = smaller (&s1, &s2);
    // let t1 = s1; // equivalent of free (s1)
    // let t2 = s2; // equivalent of free (s2)
    println! ("{}", small);                  
}                                          
```

---
### Multiple Lifetime Parameters

Why can't we free s2?

```rust
fn append <'a> (s: &'a mut String, n: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    s.push_str (n);
    s
}

fn main() {
    let mut s1 = String::from("ip"); 
    let s2 = String::from(" workshop"); 
    let title = append (&mut s1, &s2);
    // let t1 = s1; // equivalent of free (s1)
    let t2 = s2; // equivalent of free (s2)
    println! ("{}", title);                  
}                                          
```
---
### Multiple Lifetime Parameters

Why can't we free s2?

```rust
fn append <'a, 'b> (s: &'a mut String, n: &'b str) -> &'a str {
    s.push_str (n);
    s
}

fn main() {
    let mut s1 = String::from("ip"); 
    let s2 = String::from(" workshop"); 
    let title = append (&mut s1, &s2);
    // let t1 = s1; // equivalent of free (s1)
    let t2 = s2; // equivalent of free (s2)
    println! ("{}", title);                  
}                                          
```

---
## Lifetimes - `struct`s

- Structs (and struct members) can have lifetime parameters.

```rust
struct Pizza(String);
struct PizzaSlice<'a> {
    pizza: &'a Pizza,  // <- references in structs must
    index: u32,        //    ALWAYS have explicit lifetimes
}

let p1 = Pizza("salamy".to_string());
{
    let s1 = PizzaSlice { pizza: &p1, index: 2 }; // this is okay
}

let s2;
{
    let p2 = Pizza("salamy".to_string());
    s2 = PizzaSlice { pizza: &p2, index: 2 };
    // no good - why?
}
```

- Currently Rust does not support self-referential structs out-of-box.

---
## Lifetimes - `struct`s

- Lifetimes can be constrained to "outlive" others.
    - Same syntax as type constraint: `<'b: 'a>`.

```rust
struct Pizza(String);
struct PizzaSlice<'a> { pizza: &'a Pizza, index: u32 }
struct PizzaConsumer<'a, 'b: 'a> { // says "b outlives a"
    slice: PizzaSlice<'a>, // <- currently eating this one
    pizza: &'b Pizza,      // <- so we can get more pizza
}

fn get_another_slice(c: &mut PizzaConsumer, index: u32) {
    c.slice = PizzaSlice { pizza: c.pizza, index: index };
}

let p = Pizza("salamy".to_string());
{
    let s = PizzaSlice { pizza: &p, index: 1 };
    let mut c = PizzaConsumer { slice: s, pizza: &p };
    get_another_slice(&mut c, 2);
}
```

---
## Lifetimes - `'static`

- There is one reserved, special lifetime, named `'static`.
- `'static` means that a reference may be kept (and will be valid) for the
  lifetime of the entire program.
    - i.e. the data referred to will never go out of scope.
- All `&str` literals have the `'static` lifetime.

```rust
let s1: &str = "Hello";
let s2: &'static str = "World";
```

---
### Structured Data With Lifetimes

- Any struct or enum that contains a reference must have an explicit lifetime.
- Normal lifetime rules otherwise apply.

```rust
struct Foo<'a, 'b> {
  v: &'a String,
  s: &'b str,
}
```

---
### Lifetimes in `impl` Blocks

- Implementing methods on `Foo` struct requires lifetime annotations too!
- You can read this block as "the implementation using the lifetimes `'a` and
    `'b` for the struct `Foo` using the lifetimes `'a` and `'b`."

```rust
impl<'a, 'b> Foo<'a, 'b> {
  fn new(v: &'a String, s: &'b str) -> Foo<'a, 'b> {
    Foo {
      v: v,
      s: s,
    }
  }
}
```

---
## Lifetime Elision Rules


1. Each __elided lifetime__ in the __parameters__ becomes a __distinct lifetime__ parameter.

2. If there is __exactly one lifetime__ used in the parameters (elided or not), that lifetime is assigned to __all elided output lifetimes__.

3. If the receiver has type __&Self__ or __&mut Self__, then the __lifetime of__ that reference to __Self__ is assigned to __all elided output lifetime__ parameters.
