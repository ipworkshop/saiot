# Tock Folders Review

In `/home/tock` you have:
```bash
+-- tock                # original Tock repositories
|   +-- tock                # kernel
|   +-- libtock-c           # C userspace
|   +-- libtock-rs          # Rust userspace
|
+-- /tock-saiot           # our Tock version (with POSIX and Renode emulation)
|   +-- tock                # kernel
|   +-- libtock-c           # C userspace
```

---

## Tock kernel source

In `/home/tock-saiot/tock` you have:
```bash
+-- tock            # kernel
|   +-- arch            # code specific to MCUs (ARM, RISC-V)
|   +-- boards          # code specific to boards (STM32F412G Discovery Kit)
|   |   +-- stm32f4discovery     # the stm32f4 emulated board
|   |   +-- ...         # other boards
|   +-- capsules        # drivers
|   +-- chips           # code specific to MCUs (STM32F412G, E310, )
|   +-- doc             # documentation
|   +-- kernel          # actual kernel (scheduler, ipc, memory)
|   +-- libraries       # libraries used by all the source code
|   +-- tools           # scripts for testing on other tools
|   +-- vagrant         # VM setup (different from ours)

# Tock Capsules

There are two types of capsules:
  1. API
    - export syscalls to user space
    - implement `Driver`
    - Examples: `led`, `gpio`, ...

    TODO image

  2. Service
    - used by other capsules
    - implement one or more of the HILs
    - usually talk to some hardware device
    - Examples: `l3gd20`, `lsm303dlhc`, ...

    TODO image

---

## Workpoint 1 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Implement a temperature sensors capsule

1. Write a struct that implements the `Temperature` HIL
  - next to `main.rs` write a file `temperature_emualtion.rs`
2. Add the `temperature` driver to `main.rs` and link it to your driver
  - take a look at `main.rs` for `stm32f412gdiscovery`
3. Load the `sensors` application
  - in `libtock-c/examples/sensors`

HINT: the sensor value returned will be a static value

---

## Workpoint 2 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Modify the previous example to return a different value every time you query the temperature.

HINT: there is no random number generator, but you can count how many times a query has been made

---

# Asynchronous Development

Similar to NodeJS event loop
  - usually one single thread
  - request something
  - do something else
  - get a notification
  - do something with the requested response


---

## Workpoint 3 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Implement a loop in the `hello` driver.

```rust
/// The driver system calls implementation
impl Driver for Hello {
    /// subscribe and allow will use the default implementation
    /// command syscall
    fn command(&self, command_num: usize, _data1: usize, _data2: usize, _app_id: AppId) -> ReturnCode {
        match command_num {
            // command_num 0 is used to verify if the driver exists
            0 => ReturnCode::SUCCESS,
            1 => { debug! ("Print Hello"); ReturnCode::SUCCESS }
            2 => {
                // modify number
                loop {
                    self.nr.set (self.nr.get () + 1);
                }
                ReturnCode::SuccessWithValue { value: self.nr.get() }
            }
            // the command number is not defined
            _ => ReturnCode::ENOSUPPORT,
        }
    }
}
```

What is the problem with this?

---
## Tock is asynchronous

- Apps may be preempted
- Drivers may not be interrupted
  - no use of delay in drivers 

.center[![Do not disturb](../images/do-not-disturb.jpg)]

---
## Asynchronous Development Principles

Like an event loop

- schedule next action
- wait for events
- repeat

## How drivers work

## Asynchronous HIL

.column[
Peripheral trait
  - exposes actions

PeripheralClient client trait
  - receives notification
]

.column[.center[.splash_vertical[![Scheduler](../images/syscall.svg)]]]

---

### Actual HIL

You request actions from the peripheral.

```rust
trait Peripheral {
    fn request_action (&self, /* ... */) -> ReturnCode;
    // ...
    fn set_client (&self, client: &'static dyn PeripheralClient);
}
```

### HIL's Client(s)

The peripheral will call this function when the action is done.

```rust
trait PeripheralClient {
    fn action_done (&self, /* ... */);
    // ...
}
```

---
## Asynchronous HIl usage

In a driver, when the user space requests a command:
  1. the driver makes a request to the HIL
  2. returns control to the kernel (so that processes can run)
  3. the driver is eventually notified via the HIL's client
  4. the driver notifies the app
  5. the app has to yield to get the callback

```rust
impl Driver for TheDriver {
    fn command(&self, command_num: usize, _data1: usize, _data2: usize, _app_id: AppId) -> ReturnCode {
        match command_num {
            0 => ReturnCode::SUCCESS,
            1 => self.peripheral.request_action (/* ... */) // this usually returns a ReturnCode
            _ => ReturnCode::ENOSUPPORT
        }
    }
    // ...
}

impl PeripheralClient for TheDriver {
    fn action_done (&self) {
        // ... notify the process
    }
}
```

How do we notify the process?

---
## Optional Cell

Similar to `Cell<Option<T>>`, but has some useful functions:

.right[.card[.large_vertical[![OptionalCell](../images/sep_optionalcell.png)]]]

---
### Subscribe

We use the subscribe mechanism:

```rust
struct TheDriver {
    callback: OptionalCell<Callback>
    // ...
}

impl Driver for TheDriver {
    fn subscribe(&self, subscribe_num: usize, callback: Option<Callback>, appid: AppId) -> ReturnCode {
        match subscribe_num {
            0 => self.callback.put (callback)
        }
    }
    // ...
}

impl PeripheralClient for TheDriver {
    fn action_done (&self, /* ... */) {
        let data1 = ..., data2 = ..., data3 = ...
        self.callback.map (|callback| callback.schedule (data1, data2, data3));
    }
}
```

---
### Subscribe in user space app

In the app, you have to subscribe first:

```c
static event_from_driver (int data1, int data2, int data3, void *user_data) {
    // ...
}

int main ()
{
    void *user_data = ... // may be NULL
    subscribe (THE_DRIVER_NUMBER, 0, event_from_driver, user_data);
    command (THE_DRIVER_NUMBER, 1, 0, 0);
    yield ();
}
```

---

class: split-50
### System Call Pattern

.column[
1. Allow a buffer
2. Subscribe
3. Send a Command
4. Yield
5. Verify if your callback was called
  - yes, continue
  - no, yield again
]

.column[
.right[.card[.large_vertical[![System Call Pattern](../images/sep_syscall_pattern.png)]]]
]

---
# Workpoint 4 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Make the `Hello` driver asynchronous, it returns the counter via a subscribe.

```rust
/// The driver system calls implementation
impl Driver for Hello {
    /// allow will use the default implementation
    fn subscribe(&self, subscribe_num: usize, callback: Option<Callback>, appid: AppId) -> ReturnCode {
        match command_num {
            0 => // set the callback
            _ => ReturnCode::ENOSUPPORT,
        }
    }
    /// command syscall
    fn command(&self, command_num: usize, _data1: usize, _data2: usize, _app_id: AppId) -> ReturnCode {
        match command_num {
            // command_num 0 is used to verify if the driver exists
            0 => ReturnCode::SUCCESS,
            1 => { debug! ("Print Hello"); ReturnCode::SUCCESS }
            2 => {
                // modify number
                self.nr.set (self.nr.get () + 1);
                // schedule the callback
                ReturnCode::SUCCESS
            }
            // the command number is not defined
            _ => ReturnCode::ENOSUPPORT,
        }
    }
}
```
