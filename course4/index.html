# Overview

1. Tock Development Environment
2. Renode Emulator
3. Tock

---

# Development Environment

You will have to install:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - a powerfull source code editor 
    - [RLS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust) - the Rust extension
    - [Remote SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh-tutorial) - the connection to the virtual machine

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - a Linux environment&sup1; with the Tock setup
  - [Extension Pack](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.12/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-6.1.12.vbox-extpack) - you will be able to see you USB devices in guest virtual machine

- [Tock Virtual Machine](https://wyliodrinstudio.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/images/Tock-SAIoT.ova) - Import Appliance
    - [Modified](https://github.com/UPBIoT/renode-iot)&sup2; version of [Renode](https://renode.io/)
    - [Modified](https://github.com/UPBIoT/tock/tree/saiot)&sup2; version of Tock to run in [Renode](https://renode.io/)
    - Windows: Make sure you select __Allow__ when you get a question from the Firewall

&sup1;If you are running Linux, this step is recommended, not necessary.<br>
&sup2;You do need these for simulating Tock

---
## Virtual Box

1. Install the [Extension Pack](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.12/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-6.1.12.vbox-extpack)
2. Import Appliance [Tock-SAIoT](https://wyliodrinstudio.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/images/Tock-SAIoT.ova)



---
## Visual Studio Code

Setup the Extensions:
  - [RLS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust) - the Rust extension
  - [Remote SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh-tutorial) - the connection to the virtual machine

.center[.title[![Remote SHH Link](../images/vscode_ssh.png)]]

---

### SSH connect

1. Start the Virtual Machine with Tock
2. Connect to host: `tock@localhost:2000`&sup1; (password: `tock`)

.center[.title[![Remote SHH Link](../images/vscode_ssh_link.png)]]

&sup1; Due to an issue with the Remote SSH Extension, you will always have to write `tock@localhost:2000`, it will not be remebered.

# Renode

SoC Emulator
  - Very simple emulation of Cortex-M and STM32F4Discovery
  - Patches required for Tock (`stm32f4xx` chip) and Renode (pending interrupts)

Use our patched [Renode](https://github.com/UPBIoT/renode-iot)

Included in the [Tock Virtual Machine](https://wyliodrinstudio.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/images/Tock-SAIoT.ova)

---

## Using Renode

- Use the [Tock Virtual Machine](https://wyliodrinstudio.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/images/Tock-SAIoT.ova) 
  - Import Appliance
  - Windows: Make sure you select __Allow__ when you get a question from the Firewall

- Use the `stm32f4discovery` board from `/home/tock/tock-saiot/tock/boards/stm32f4discovery`.

---
# Tock

- A <b>preemptive</b> embedded OS (runs on MCUs)
  - Cortex-M
  - RISC-V
- Uses memory protection (MPU required)
- Has separate <b>kernel and user space</b>
  - most embedded OS have the one piece software philosophy
- Runs untrusted apps in user space
- <b>Microkernel</b> architecture
- Kernel (and drivers) written in Rust
- Apps written in C/C++ or Rust (any language that can be compiled)

# Let's write some code for Tock

In `/wyliodrin` you have:
```bash
+-- tock                # original Tock repositories
|   +-- tock                # kernel
|   +-- libtock-c           # C userspace
|   +-- libtock-rs          # Rust userspace
|
+-- /tock-saiot           # our Tock version (with POSIX emulation and emulator modification)
|   +-- tock                # kernel
|   +-- libtock-c           # C userspace
```

# A few words about how Tock boots

In `/home/tock-posix/tock` you have:
```bash
+-- tock            # kernel
|   +-- arch            # code specific to MCUs (ARM, RISC-V)
|   +-- boards          # code specific to boards (STM32F412G Discovery Kit)
|   +-- capsules        # drivers
|   +-- chips           # code specific to MCUs (STM32F412G, E310, )
|   +-- doc             # documentation
|   +-- kernel          # actual kernel (scheduler, ipc, memory)
|   +-- libraries       # libraries used by all the source code
|   +-- tools           # scripts for testing on other tools
|   +-- vagrant         # VM setup (different from ours)
```

# Workpoint 2 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

In `main.rs`, find the line that prints the start message, and write a message of your own.

```bash
Initialization complete. Entering main loop
```

Example

```bash
Welcome from Tock
```

    520     200    2396    3116     c2c build/cortex-m3/cortex-m3.elf
Application size report for target cortex-m4:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    520     200    2396    3116     c2c build/cortex-m4/cortex-m4.elf
```

Now you have built the `c_hello` application.

---
## Compile the kernel with the app

Use the `tock-saiot` folder. The kernel folder is called 'tock', the apps folder is called `libtock-c`.

In `boards/stm32f4discovery` edit the application name in the `Makefile`

```bash
APP=../../../libtock-c/examples/blink/build/cortex-m4/cortex-m4.tbf
# blink id the app name here
KERNEL=$(TOCK_ROOT_DIRECTORY)/target/$(TARGET)/debug/$(PLATFORM).elf
KERNEL_WITH_APP=$(TOCK_ROOT_DIRECTORY)/target/$(TARGET)/debug/$(PLATFORM)-app.elf
```

```bash
make program
```

Now you should have a Tock kernal and application running.
Hint: 
1. The application name here is `blink`, change it with another application to run something different.
2. To run several applications, use `cat app1.tbf app2.tbf > app.bundle` and use the `app.bundle` for the `APP` variable

## Scheduler

The `Scheduler` trait

- Round Robun
- Cooperative
- Priority Queue

```rust
/// Trait which any scheduler must implement.
pub trait Scheduler<C: Chip> {
    /// Decide which process to run next.
    ///
    /// The scheduler must decide whether to run a process, and if so, which one.
    /// If the scheduler chooses not to run a process, it can request that the chip
    /// enter sleep mode.
    fn next(&self, kernel: &Kernel) -> SchedulingDecision;

    /// Inform the scheduler of why the last process stopped executing, and how
    /// long it executed for. Notably, `execution_time_us` will be `None`
    /// if the the scheduler requested this process be run cooperatively.
    fn result(&self, result: StoppedExecutingReason, execution_time_us: Option<u32>);

    /// and dynamic deferred calls. Most schedulers will use this default
    /// implementation, but schedulers which at times wish to defer interrupt
    /// handling will reimplement it.
    ///
    /// Providing this interface allows schedulers to fully manage how
    /// the main kernel loop executes. For example, a more advanced
    /// scheduler that attempts to help processes meet their deadlines may
    /// need to defer bottom half interrupt handling or to selectively service
    /// certain interrupts. Or, a power aware scheduler may want to selectively
    /// choose what work to complete at any time to meet power requirements.

    /// priority schedulers which wish to check if the execution of the current process
    /// has caused a higher priority process to become ready (such as in the case of IPC).

]

---

### 0: Yield

Yield transitions the current process from the Running to the Yielded state, and
the process will not execute again until another callback re-schedules the
process.

If a process has enqueued callbacks waiting to execute when Yield is called, the
process immediately re-enters the Running state and the first callback runs.

```rust
yield()
```

##### Arguments

None.

##### Return

None.

---

### 1: Subscribe

Subscribe assigns callback functions to be executed in response to various
events.
- a callback function has a *callback ID* (`driver`,`subscribe_number`), 
- null pointer disables the callback

```rust
subscribe(driver: u32, subscribe_number: u32, callback: u32, userdata: u32) -> ReturnCode as u32
```

##### Arguments

 - `driver`: An integer specifying which driver to call.
 - `subscribe_number`: An integer index for which function is being subscribed.
 - `callback`: A pointer to a callback function to be executed when this event
 occurs. `void callback(int arg1, int arg2, int arg3, void* data)`.
 - `userdata`: A pointer to a value of any type that will be passed back

##### Return

 - `ENODEVICE` if `driver` does not refer to a valid kernel driver.
 - `ENOSUPPORT` if the driver exists but doesn't support the `subscribe_number`.
 - Other return codes based on the specific driver.

---

### 2: Command

Command instructs the driver to perform a specific action.

```rust
command(driver: u32, command_number: u32, argument1: u32, argument2: u32) -> ReturnCode as u32
```

#### Arguments

 - `driver`: An integer specifying which driver to call.
 - `command_number`: An integer specifying the requested command.
 - `argument1`: A command-specific argument.
 - `argument2`: A command-specific argument.

- One Tock convention with the Command syscall is that command number 0 will
always return a value of 0 or greater if the driver is supported.

#### Return

 - `ENODEVICE` if `driver` does not refer to a valid kernel driver.
 - `ENOSUPPORT` if the driver exists but doesn't support the `command_number`.
 - Other return codes based on the specific driver.

---

### 3: Allow

Allow shares memory buffers between the kernel and application.
- null pointer revokes sharing a region.

```rust
allow(driver: u32, allow_number: u32, pointer: usize, size: u32) -> ReturnCode as u32
```

#### Arguments

 - `driver`: An integer specifying which driver should be granted access.
 - `allow_number`: A driver-specific integer specifying the purpose of this
   buffer.
 - `pointer`: A pointer to the start of the buffer in the process memory space.
 - `size`: An integer number of bytes specifying the length of the buffer.

#### Return

 - `ENODEVICE` if `driver` does not refer to a valid kernel driver.
 - `ENOSUPPORT` if the driver exists but doesn't support the `allow_number`.
 - `EINVAL` the buffer referred to by `pointer` and `size` lies completely or
partially outside of the processes addressable RAM.
 - Other return codes based on the specific driver.

---

### 4: Memop

Memop expands the memory segment available to the process, allows the process to
retrieve pointers to its allocated memory space, provides a mechanism for
the process to tell the kernel where its stack and heap start, and other
operations involving process memory.

```rust
memop(op_type: u32, argument: u32) -> [[ VARIES ]] as u32
```

#### Arguments

 - `op_type`: An integer indicating whether this is a `brk` (0), a `sbrk` (1),
   or another memop call.
 - `argument`: The argument to `brk`, `sbrk`, or other call.

Each memop operation is specific and details of each call can be found in
the [memop syscall documentation](syscalls/memop.md).

#### Return

- Dependent on the particular memop call.


---
## Workpoint 4 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Enable the system calls trace in `kernel/src/config.rs`. 
1. Upload an app that prints a text on the shell using `printf`. 
  - How many system calls is printf using?
  - What is the driver number of the driver used for printing?

2. Upload the blink app and look at the system calls trace.
  - What is led's driver number?

## Workpoint 5 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

1. Write and upload and app that faults.
```c
int main(void)
{
      int *s = NULL;
      *s = 0;
      return 0;
}
```

2. Modify the app fault policy so that it does not panic when an app faults
  - hint: `main.rs` serach for `FAULT_RESPONSE`.
